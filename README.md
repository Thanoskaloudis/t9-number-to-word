# T9 Number-to-Word Converter

## Description

An application that simulates the behavior of a T9-style keyboard. The user gives input, and the app prints one of the possible words. For example, for input "43556" the output will be "hello". 

## Set up
1. Make sure Node and npm are installed from the terminal. For the CLIENT run:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the project.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

3. Now you can visit http://localhost:3000 to view the client

4. Now, navigate to ./server and run 
    ```
    npm install
    ```
5. Start the server.

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
6. The server will now run on http://localhost:8000

## Notes

* Back End has been created using Node and more specifically Express Library.
